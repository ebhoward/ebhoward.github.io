### Quantum IPMP Tools

I have developed a set of Quantum IPMP Tools that can be accessed via the QGIS Processing Toolbox Scripts.  These tools support planners in designing industrial park layouts in hilly terrain.

More information is available [here](/resources.html).

You can download the Quantum IPMP Tools from [Github](https://github.com/ebhoward/QuantumIPMPTools).

Welcome to the DigitalizedPlanning blog!



## Digitalization

Many professional fields will be increasingly affected by digital transformation, automation and artificial intelligence. 

The digitalization of urban planning and masterplanning work is still at a relatively early stage. 

Digitalization has positive and negative consequences. There are fears that digitalization will de-professionalize urban planning and masterplanning work. On the other hands, digital tools will enable a far higher quantity *and* quality of analysis, design and evaluation.

Better and faster planning work are critical to meeting sustainable development goals for the future of the world.


## Purpose

The purpose of this blog is to share knowledge, experience, trends and tools in the digitalization of the urban planning and masterplanning fields and to stimulate discussion among planners, related professionals, governments, developers and the general public.

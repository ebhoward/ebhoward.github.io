Welcome to the DigitalizedPlanning blog!

## Digitalization

Many professional fields are increasingly affected by digital transformation, automation and artificial intelligence. The digitalization of urban planning and masterplanning work are still at a relatively early stage. 

Digitalization has positive and negative consequences. There are fears that digitalization will de-professionalize urban planning and masterplanning work. On the other hands, digital tools will enable a far higher quantity *and* quality of analysis, design and evaluation in planning work.


## Purpose

The purpose of this blog is to share knowledge and experience in digitalization of the urban planning and masterplanning fields and to stimulate discussion among planners, related professionals, governments, developers and the general public.

Hi! I'm Ebenezer Howard.

I have thirty years' experience in urban planning, masterplanning, business consulting and software development with projects around the world.

This blog has been created to for planners, related professionals, government officials, developers and the general public to share all things related to digitalized urban planning and masterplanning.

Enjoy!
